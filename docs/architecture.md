# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The GitAdventure project is a modular full-stack application designed for scalability and maintainability. It uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, and Express.js for the backend.

## Backend

The backend is built with Express.js and follows a service-based architecture. Key components include:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and delegate to services.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Repositories**: Abstract database operations.
- **Middlewares**: Implement custom request handling logic.
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints.

The backend communicates with a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) and provides RESTful APIs for the frontend.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application structured for modularity. Key components include:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements.
- **Pages**: Represent individual views or screens.
- **Services**: Handle API interactions.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state and logic reuse.
- **Styles**: Centralized styling using CSS modules or libraries.

The frontend uses Vite for fast development and build processes.

## Communication

The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. Authentication and data exchange are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and JSON payloads. The application ensures secure and efficient communication through HTTPS and proper error handling.
